The floor area ratio is the ratio between the residential floor area and land dedicated to residences.", "In a large, car-dependent city, population density is limited by traffic congestion rather than building space. Hence such cities tend to have large single-family homes on large lots.", "The 30 minutes travel radius is based on Marchetti's constant [marchetti], the observation that, historically, humans tend to spend on average one hour commuting each day (30 minutes each way). In practice, the largest metros exceed the estimates above by growing beyond the 30 minute travel radius."]}, {"name": "Weight", "content": ["For most motorized vehicles, the weight of the vehicle itself greatly exceeds the weight of the passengers or cargo being transported, with the major exception active transportation: walking and biking.", "-vehicle_weight.jpg", "!Car weights reported by Miller-Wilson [car_weight] and tank sizes from Harbid [car_tank_size].
