This study breaks down the total growth in material usage from 1990-2010 (+33 billion tons total, from 37 to 70 billion tons). The 78 billion tons for final demand, for example, mean that total material usage would have grown 78 billion tons if final demand grew as in reality and all other factors stayed the same. The -66 for material efficiency means that if material efficiency happened as in real life, and everything else stayed the same, total material usage would have gone down 66 billion tons. These figures are mathematical formalisms, as negative resource usage is clearly impossible. \"Production recipe\" refers to the structure, but not the size, of inputs into final goods. \"Import structures\" refers to material moving, via imports, from generally more to less efficient countries.
