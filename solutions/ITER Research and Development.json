The ITER/DEMO schedule has suffered from delays and cost overruns, and now should not be expected to lead to commercial fusion power until at least the 2060s.

S. Department of Energy to fund ITER looks like a poor investment. Part of the reason is that, due to the protracted timeline of ITER development, the value of electricity generated by fusion is heavily discounted.
