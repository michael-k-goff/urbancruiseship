[abdul], the BTS [bts], and Kwan [kwan]. Energy for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) is estimated from Kasliwal et al. [flying_cars] and is assessed for a single passenger over a distance of 75-250 km, with lower per-km energy needs at longer distances. Energy for supersonic flight is estimated from Kharina et al. [supersonic].", "Emerging aviation technologies, such as personal electric vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles, could increase energy demand. While there are no commercial supersonic flights available today, several companies are working to bring them back for business travelers in the 2020s. They will be significantly more energy-intenstive than comparable subsonic flights. Even more advanced forms of flight, such as hypersonic (at least five times the speed of sound) aircraft [hypersonic] and suborbital aircraft [suborbital], are under development but far from commercialization.", "Long-haul aviation requires fuel with <a href=\"/solution/energy/transpo_fuels\">density</a> comparable to kerosene or greater.
