Subways, in and of themselves, generally cause cities to decentralize [subways_decent]. San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) was intended to reduce sprawl and concentrate development in already built-out areas, but failed to do so in significant part due to the failure of Bay Area cities to upzone near BART stations [bart]. In Japan, areas that gained access to high speed rail showed more loss of population density than those without [shinkansen]. Expansion of public transit does not, in general, cause a decrease in driving in the long run and may even increase driving in some cases [bus_induced_demand].", "<b>High-Speed Rail and Air Travel</b>", "Over longer distances, induced demand for intercity travel from high speed rail has been observed [hsr_induced_demand]. In China, the development of the high speed rail network substituted for short haul flights (less than 1000 km), but stimulated demand for long haul flights by increasing the catchment area of airports [china_hsr]. Within the European Union, high speed rail tends to substitute for flights within countries but not between countries [clewlow].", "<b>Effect of Mixed-Use Development</b>", "While mixed use developments tend to decrease total driving, a portion of the internal trips in a mixed use development are induced, rather than captured from the external network [sperry]."]}], "title": "Latent and Induced Demand", "parent_link": "cities_mobility", "parent_name": "Mobility", "references": [{"ref": "vmt_lanes4", "author": "Cervero, R.", "title": "Road Expansion, Urban Growth, and Induced Travel: A Path Analysis", "journal": "Journal of the American Planning Association <b>69</b>(2), pp. 145-163", "date": "2003", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944360308976303"}, {"ref": "vmt_lanes5", "author": "Graham, D., McCoy, E., Stephens, D.", "title": "Quantifying Causal Effects of Road Network Capacity Expansions on Traffic Volume and Density via a Mixed Model Propensity Score Estimator", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association <b>109</b>(508), pp. 1440-1449", "date": "October 2014", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2014.956871"}, {"ref": "vmt_lanes6", "author": "Handy, S., Boarnet, M.", "title": "Impact of Highway Capacity and Induced Travel on Passenger Vehicle Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions;
