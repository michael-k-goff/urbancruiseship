Subways, in and of themselves, generally cause cities to decentralize [subways_decent]. San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) was intended to reduce sprawl and concentrate development in already built-out areas, but failed to do so in significant part due to the failure of Bay Area cities to upzone near BART stations [bart]. In Japan, areas that gained access to high speed rail showed more loss of population density than those without [shinkansen].
