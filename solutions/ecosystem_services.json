Valuations by biome are global averages across studies reported in the Ecosystem Services Partnership [esp], and even for the same biome estimates can vary widely depending on location and study methodology. Local use of habitat valuation should be based on local measurements, rather than global averages. Valuations are based on instrumental value of ecosystems for human needs and do not take into account a conservationist ethic."]}], "title": "Ecosystem Service Pricing", "parent_link": "economy", "parent_name": "Priorities", "references": [{"ref": "costanza", "author": "Costanza, R., de Groot, R., Sutton, P., van der Ploeg, S., Anderson, S., Kubiszewski, I., Farber, S., Turner, R.", "title": "Changes in the global value of ecosystem services", "journal": "Global Environmental Change <b>26</b>, pp. 152-158", "date": "May 2014", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378014000685?via%3Dihub"}, {"ref": "degroot", "author": "de Groot, R. et al.", "title": "Global estimates of the value of ecosystems and their services in monetary units", "journal": "Ecosystem Services <b>1</b>(1), pp. 50-61", "date": "July 2012", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041612000101#t0010"}, {"ref": "esp", "author": "Van der Ploeg, S., de Groot R.
