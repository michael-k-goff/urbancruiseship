Broadly speaking, we may divide them as follows [aqua_energy].  Extensive practices, which are the most common for fish today, are low-density, carried out in ocean conditions and rely heavily on the natural environment for feedstock.  Intensive aquaculture is conducted in tanks, ponds, and open-water cages, is much denser, and relies almost entirely on industrial feedstock.  Today, extensive farming is most common, but industry is shifting toward intensive production [aqua_energy]."], "name": "Aquaculture Overview"}, {"content": ["On the surface, aquaculture is more efficient than <a href='/solution/ag_animals'>land-based livestock</a>.  Salmon, for instance, has a reported feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1.2 [salmon_fcr], much less than beef and other kinds of meat.  This means that 1.2 kilograms of feed are required to gain one kilogram of salmon growth. However, feed for salmon and other carnivorous fish requires protein from animal sources rather than plants.", "In considering the sustainability of ocean resources and fish farming, a more relevant measure is the forage fish dependency ratio (FFDR), which measures the weight of fish needed to produce a weight of final product.  A recent Norwegian study [fifo_norway] found that the FFDR of Norwegian salmon has improved from 4.4 in 1990 to 0.7 in 2013, and also that 0.7 kg of marine protein were needed to produce 1 kg of salmon protein.  These figures show that, at least in terms of fish biomass harvested from the ocean, salmon farming can have a lighter footprint than wild catching if done properly.  This dramatic improvement has been achieved in part by reducing the marine-originating content of the salmon feed from 90% to 30% [fifo_norway].  Recycling discarded fish trimmings into fish meal can further improve the FFDR [fifo_norway].", "Tacon and Metian [tacon] found that herbivorous and omnivorous fish require much less input than carnivorous fish such as salmon.  They use the fish in/fish out metric (FIFO), closely related to FFDR [fifo_def]. They found the following world average ratios [tacon].", "?Fish|FIFO?    Salmon|4.9?    Freshwater Crustaceans|0.6?

Aquaculture has been implicated in the loss of mangroves [aqua_impact3].", "One tool for reducing the impact of aquaculture is integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) [aqua_impact3].  IMTA is a system that farms different species at different trophic levels (i.e. different positions on the food chain), which allows internal recycling of nutrients and reduces pollution [aqua_impact3].  Compared to monoculture, IMTA requires less feed per unit of seafood farmed [fifo_def].", "Detailed and reliable lifecycle analyses of aquaculture are limited.  A 2011 study [aqua_lca] aggregated several environmental factors and found that farmed salmon has four times the impact of fished cod (per kilogram of fish) and a greater impact than all terrestrial meat except veal.

An RAS brings several potential advantages over conventional aquaculture.  Pollution is greatly reduced, as is the risk of gene flow in the ocean; land and water requirements are lower compared to open pond and raceway aquaculture systems; and the control over the tank allows for much better management of disease [ras].  However, an RAS is more expensive due to greater labor, capital, and energy requirements [ras].  In particular, as a result of the high electricity demands, an RAS is estimated to have about four times the acidification potential, four time the global warming potential, and 40% more land requirement (including upstream requirements) [aqua_lca2].", "RAS is still a niche technology.
