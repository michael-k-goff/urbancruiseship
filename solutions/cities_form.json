Density alone--in this scenario going from single-family homes with the median American lot size to high rise urban development--can reduce vehicle-miles traveled by 29%, but an integrated strategy that uses all of the following tools may decrease VMT by 61%.", "-Urban Form and VMT.jpg", "!Vehicle miles travelled reduction by various strategies. Sources: density and the integrated strategy from the National Research Council [nap_vmt], mixed used development from Ewing and Cervero [ewing_cervero], centralized urban shape and polycentricitiy from Lee [urban_shape], rail and buses from Tal et al.

Kentlands hosts a diverse housing mix, including 27% single-family detached homes, 20% townhomes, 46% multi-family, and 7% urban cottages, and has about three times the population density of Gaithersburg [texas_smart_growth]. Indicating a market demand for dense and walkable neighborhoods, homes in Kentlands sell at a premium of 13% relative to comparable homes in the region [full_circle]. While travel data is limited, Kentlands remains a highly automobile-dependent neighborhood, due in part to the failure to plan for adequate transit [texas_smart_growth].", "-kentlands.jpg-30", "!Kentlands.

In 2016, cycling accounted for 27% of all trips [cycling_facts], the highest of any large country, and VMT from cycling was about 9% of VMT from driving [vmt_comparison]. The Dutch achieved high rates of cycling through separated bike lanes, bicycling parking, bike share programs, intercity bike networks, safety and liability regulations that favor cyclists, urban density, integration with public transport, and restrictions on driving.
