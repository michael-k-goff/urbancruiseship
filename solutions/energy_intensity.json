The economic energy efficiency of the world economy is the monetary output per unit energy, and this figure was over $200 per gigajoule in 2018. It has increased by over 50% since 1990, indicating both that more economic activity is generated for each unit of energy, and that efficiency is improving over time [bp2019][world_bank_ppp].", "-World Energy Intensity.jpg", "The world economy may triple from 2015 to 2050 [pwc2050]. If the 1990-2018 average annual percentage increase in efficiency continues to 2050, then the world's energy will generate $312 per GJ, but the world energy demand will be 987 exajoules, nearly 70% more than today's value.", "-efficiency_projection.jpg-60", "Economic energy efficiency varies by country.  The following shows efficiency for selected countries in 1990 and in 2018, using PPP.", "-Energy Intensity by Country.jpg-60", "Economic energy efficiency is driven by several factors: technical efficiency, the design of cities, climate, personal behavior, and the composition of the economy [doe_ei].  For individual countries, trade of energy-intensive products can affect observed efficiency [nelder]. Some of the observed improvement in energy efficiency is the result of switching to higher quality fuels [kaufman][stern_world_ei]. In general, the efficiency metric covers many factors that are unrelated to technical energy efficiency [doe_alt_ei].", "The above figures measure economic energy efficiency by considering modern forms of energy. The historical pattern is that efficiency tends to fall as a country develops, and after that it rises [stern]. However, if the energy inherent in biomass (e.g. crops, firewood) is also included, then the pattern is that energy intensity rises even in the early stages of industrialization [ayres_warr][stern]."]}], "title": "Economic Energy Efficiency", "parent_link": "economy", "parent_name": "Economics", "references": [{"title": "PPP Versus the Market: Which Weight Matters?", "url": "http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2007/03/basics.htm", "journal": "Finance and Development, International Monetary Fund", "author": "Callen T.", "date": "March 2007", "ref": "callen"}, {"date": "Accessed April 24, 2019", "url": "https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD", "title": "GDP, PPP (constant 2011 international $)", "ref": "world_bank_ppp", "author": "World Bank"}, {"date": "2019", "url": "https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html", "title": "Statistical Review of World Energy 2019", "ref": "bp2019", "author": "BP"}, {"url": "http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/the-economy/the-world-in-2050.jhtml", "date": "February 2015", "title": "The World in 2050: Will the shift in global economic power continue?", "ref": "pwc2050", "author": "Hawksworth, J., Chan, D."}, {"date": "Accessed July 9, 2015", "url": "http://www1.eere.energy.gov/analysis/eii_total_energy.html", "title": "Energy Intensity Indicators: Highlights", "ref": "doe_ei", "author": "U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency."}, {"url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_efficient_planet/2013/03/energy_intensity_is_a_misleading_metric_in_the_fight_against_climate_change.single.html", "journal": "Slate", "title": "The Worst Way to Measure Energy Efficiency", "ref": "nelder", "author": "Nelder, C"}, {"title": "The Mechanisms for Autonomous Energy Efficiency Increases: A Cointegration Analysis of the US Energy/GDP Ratio", "url": "http://www.researchgate.net/publication/227363565_The_Mechanisms_for_Autonomous_Energy_Efficiency_Increases_A_Cointegration_Analysis_of_the_US_EnergyGDP_Ratio", "journal": "Energy Journal <b>25</b> (1), pp. 63-86", "author": "Kaufman, R.", "date": "January 2004", "ref": "kaufman"}, {"title": "Modeling International Trends in Energy Efficiency and Carbon Emissions", "url": "http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/94950/2/EERH_RR54.pdf", "journal": "Environmental Economics  Research  Hub Research  Reports, Research Report No. 54.", "author": "Stern, D.", "date": "March 2010", "ref": "stern_world_ei"}, {"date": "Accessed March 27, 2019", "url": "https://www.energy.gov/eere/analysis/energy-intensity-indicators", "title": "Energy Intensity Indicators", "ref": "doe_alt_ei", "author": "U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency"}, {"title": "The Role of Energy in Economic Growth", "url": "http://ccep.anu.edu.au/data/2010/pdf/wpaper/CCEP-3-10.pdf", "journal": "Centre for Climate & Economics Policy, Working Paper 3.10", "author": "Stern, D.", "date": "October 2010", "ref": "stern"}, {"title": "Accounting for Growth: The Role of Physical Work", "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954349X03000778", "journal": "Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, <b>16</b>(2), pp. 181-209.", "author": "Ayres, R., Warr, B.", "date": "June 2005", "ref": "ayres_warr"}]}
