The figures are imprecise, with actual damage depending on tire conditions, climate, type of pavement, and other factors [truck300]. The ratio of damage done by a typical semi truck to a typical car, for instance, has been estimated at 9600 [truck9600] or the 300s [truck300].

The disparity in road damage by vehicle weight calls for an evaluation of how this maintenance bill is paid. Although large trucks do at least 99% of road damage, they pay only 35% of maintenance costs, suggesting a subsidy for trucking [true_cost_trucks]. Mileage fees are a way to rectify this imbalance. An appropriate per-km fee (in 2020 USD) for Ontario, Canada has been estimated at 0.8 &cent;/km on freeways and 92 &cent;/km on local roads [canada_truck].", "Development triggers vehicle traffic which causes road damage.
