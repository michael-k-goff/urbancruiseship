The United States has a technical potential of 8840 MW from waste heat to power (WHP) systems, of which 2904 MW should be accepted by the market [ornl_whp].", "@Industrial Waste Heat Recovery Loan Program@The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office [doe_loan] should explore low interest loans to companies wishing to build infrastructure to recycle industrial heat. Many firms already exist to build this infrastructure, and they offer consulting and assessment [genalta]. In the U.S., there is enough industrial waste heat to generate 6000-8000 megawatts of electricity [epa_whp], and about 557 MW are currently recycled [whp_policy] in what is expected to be a 10.5 billion dollar industry [grandview]. Following are some barriers to further recycling:@|The process is not perceived as 'green' and therefore lacks the social capital of solar & wind initiatives.|Companies might not have room for heat recycling equipment on their premises [low_temp_whp].|Installing heat recycling equipment may involve a temporary halt in production, which affects productivity reporting and shareholder concerns.|There are risks associated with installing any new equipment at a facility, and managers fear mishaps & accidents.|Payback periods can range from 3 to 36 months [whp_video][whp_policy], while average employee tenures in the U.S. are below 5 years [bls2020]. Thus fewer individual leaders are incentivised to advocate for programs with longer paybacks [low_temp_whp].@Loans could be structured so as to eliminate the payback period only, and not necessarily cover the total cost of the heat recycling equipment installation. To be sure, the IRS currently awards a 30% tax credit for waste energy recovery expenditures, but only for facilities recycling heat into electricity [hr133].@!(5) WASTE ENERGY RECOVERY PROPERTY.\u2014 (A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The term 'waste energy recovery property' means property that generates electricity solely from heat from buildings or equipment if the primary purpose of such building or equipment is not the generation of electricity.@This excludes recycling of heat into a ventilation system for office or factory-floor spaces.
