The IPAT (Impact = Population &times; Affluence &times; Technology) formula quantifies these three tends [ipat].

For individual countries, trade of energy-intensive products can affect observed intensity [nelder]. Some of the observed improvement in intensity is the result of switching to higher quality fuels [kaufman][stern_world_ei].

This effect accounts for an estimated 18% of world CO<sub>2</sub> emissions growth from 1995 to 2007 [emissions_trade], or an additional 1.46 billion tons per year by 2007 [bp2020]. A similar effect has increased global usage of biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals, and fossil fuels [trade_rmc].", "Environmental regulation, such as carbon pricing, can cause \"leakage\", whereby imports from less regulated or taxed countries increase as a result.
