However, there are scenarios under which a reactor could be come critical in a launch failure [kilopower_safety], and therefore rules are needed to govern the launch of reactors that go beyond what has been learned with RTGs [fls2][fls1].", "Nuclear thermal rockets (NTR) have greater exhaust velocity than chemical rockets [pettit] but low impulse [ntr2]. This, together with the safety and regulatory issues around operating fission reactors in the atmosphere, might make them suitable for propulsuion but not for launch. In that case we imagine an NTR would have safety issues comparable to launching a fission reactor. Nuclear pulse propulsion, such as by Project Orion, entails the use of nuclear explosions for propulsion and is not permitted under the Partial Test Ban Treaty, even in space [npp_testban]."]}], "title": "Energy", "parent_link": "ethics", "parent_name": "Risk and Ethics", "references": [{"ref": "spacepower_solar", "author": "European Space Agency", "title": "Power Systems", "date": "Accessed November 10, 2019", "url": "http://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Power_Systems"}, {"ref": "spacepower_kilopower", "author": "Gibson, M., Oleson, S., Poston, D., McClure, P.", "title": "NASA\u2019s Kilopower Reactor Development and the Path to Higher Power Missions", "journal": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170002010.pdf"}, {"ref": "spacepower_rtg", "author": "World Nuclear Association", "title": "Nuclear Reactors and Radioisotopes for Space", "date": "Accessed November 10, 2019", "url": "https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/transport/nuclear-reactors-for-space.aspx"}, {"ref": "spacepower_fusion", "author": "Thomas, S., Paluszek, M., Cohen, S.", "title": "Fusion-Enabled Pluto Orbiter and Lander", "journal": "Phase 1 Final Report, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts grant", "date": "April 2017"}, {"ref": "mars2020eis", "author": "NASA", "title": "Environmental Impact Statement, Mars 2020 Mission", "date": "March 2020", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/news/newsroom/eis/"}, {"ref": "ulysses", "author": "Goldman, M., Nelson, R.
