Valuations by biome are global averages across studies reported in the Ecosystem Services Partnership [esp], and even for the same biome estimates can vary widely depending on location and study methodology. Local use of habitat valuation should be based on local measurements, rather than global averages. Valuations are based on instrumental value of ecosystems for human needs and do not take into account a conservationist ethic."]}, {"content": ["The social cost of carbon is an attempt to monetize future damages from greenhouse gas emissions.
