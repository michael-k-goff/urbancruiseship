For example, it is debated within sentiocentrism whether some organisms, say with smaller numbers of neurons, may be less sentient than others (gradualist sentiocentrism) [gradual_sentio]. It is also debated whether to ascribe moral standing to (possible) artificial intelligence agents [ai1][ai2] and the ethics of abortion [essentialism].", "Theocentric beliefs, also known as Creation Care, are the view that the value of nature is a result of it being created by God. While religion, and Christianity in particular, can provide a basis for valuing nature, it has also been seen as the basis for anthropocentric beliefs [simkins], especially as expressed in Genesis 1:28,", "~And God blessed them.

At a discount rate of 5%, $5.92 today is worth $1000 100 years from now. Discounting is typically done because it is possible to invest money and expect a long-term return. However, it is also reasonable to value the well-being of a person in the far future equally to a person today.", "Harmonizing these two concerns is a difficult problem for which there is no consensus on a solution [cowen_discount].

This may mean, for instance, that a higher premium is called for on policies that raise the long-term rate of economic growth and scientific progress [cowen_discount]."]}, {"name": "Precautionary Principle", "content": ["The precautionary principle is a principle in environmental ethics and policy that calls for caution and regulation in the face of scientific uncertainty. There are four major planks of the principle: taking preventive action in the face of uncertainty, shifting the burden of proof on proponents of an activity, exploring a wide range of alternatives to a possibly harmful action, and increasing public participation in decision making [precautionary].", "The precautionary principle is frequently used in environmental contexts, where there may be a threat of serious or irreversible damage [precaut_book]. The principle has also been proposed in the context of environmental ethics: when in doubt, it is better to ascribe sentience and rights to organisms [precaut_ethics].", "The precautionary principle has been criticized for hiding protectionist motivations [precaut_protection], for stifling innovation [precaut_innovation], and for being somewhat arbitrary in its application [precaut_perils]."]}], "title": "Environmental Ethics", "parent_link": "ethics", "parent_name": "Ethics", "references": [{"ref": "afeissa", "author": "Afeissa, H., Mainguy, G.", "title": "The Transformative value of Ecological Pragmatism.
