[waste1], sub-seabed disposal from porter [waste4], reprocessing from Recktenwald and Deinert [reprocessing], and other options from the National Research Council [waste2] and the NEA and OECD [waste3]. While more expensive, partioning and transmutation is the only option that (partially) destroys radioactive isotopes, rather than sequestering them, though residual waste would still need to be managed by another method [waste2]. For most of the world, sub-seabed disposal would require revisions to international law [waste5]. Reprocessing would save money on the fuel cycle by reducing the need for uranium mining, but is unlikely to be economically sound at today's uranium prices [reprocessing2]. Some other options, such as geological injection of liquified waste, or launching waste into the Sun, are probably infeasible [waste2]."]}, {"content": ["@@deep_borehole.json"]}], "title": "Nuclear Waste", "parent_link": "hazardous_waste", "parent_name": "Hazardous Waste", "references": [{"ref": "wn_waste", "author": "World Nuclear Assocation", "title": "What is nuclear waste, and what do we do with it?", "date": "Accessed October 17, 2021", "url": "https://world-nuclear.org/nuclear-essentials/what-is-nuclear-waste-and-what-do-we-do-with-it.aspx"}, {"ref": "nrc_waste", "author": "United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission", "title": "Backgrounder on Radioactive Waste", "date": "June 2019", "url": "https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/radwaste.html"}, {"ref": "hlw_lifetime", "author": "Nuclear Waste Management Organization", "title": "Radiation Risk and Safety", "date": "Accessed October 17, 2021", "url": "https://www.nwmo.ca/en/Canadas-Plan/Canadas-Used-Nuclear-Fuel/Radiation-Risk-and-Safety"}, {"ref": "hlw_products", "author": "Radioactivity", "title": "Spent fuel composition", "journal": "European Union", "date": "Accessed October 17, 2021", "url": "https://www.radioactivity.eu.com/site/pages/Spent_Fuel_Composition.htm"}, {"title": "Deep Borehole Disposal of Nuclear Waste: Final Report", "url": "https://prod-ng.sandia.gov/techlib-noauth/access-control.cgi/2012/127789.pdf", "journal": "Sandia National Laboratories, Report SAND2012-7789", "author": "Brady, P., Arnold, B., Altman, S., Vaughn, P.", "date": "September 2012", "ref": "waste1"}, {"title": "Coming to an Ocean Far From You: Sub-Seabed Repositories", "url": "http://cc.greydenpress.com/gp/CloudConferencing/CloudConferencingTemplate/Data/pdfs/12524.pdf", "journal": "15th International High-Level Radioactive Waste Management Conference, Charleston, SC, April 12-16, 2015", "author": "Porter, C.", "date": "April 2015", "ref": "waste4"}, {"title": "Cost probability analysis of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel in the US", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988312001600", "journal": "Energy Economics <b>34</b>(6), pp. 1873-1881", "author": "Recktenwald, G., Deinert, M.", "date": "August 2012", "ref": "reprocessing"}, {"title": "Disposition of High-Level Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel", "url": "https://www.nap.edu/catalog/10119/disposition-of-high-level-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel-the", "isbook": 1, "journal": "Washington, DC: The National Academies Press", "author": "National Research Council", "date": "2001", "ref": "waste2"}, {"date": "1999", "url": "https://www.oecd-nea.org/rwm/reports/1999/low-level-waste-repository-costs.pdf", "title": "Low-Level Radioactive Waste Depositories: An Analysis of Costs", "ref": "waste3", "author": "Nuclear Energy Agency, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development"}, {"title": "Sub-Seabed Burial of Nuclear Waste: If the Disposal Method Could Succeed Technically, Could It Also Succeed Legally", "url": "https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/ealr/vol41/iss2/6/", "journal": "Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review <b>41</b>(2), Article 6", "author": "Bala, A.", "date": "April 2014", "ref": "waste5"}, {"title": "The Economics of Reprocessing v.
