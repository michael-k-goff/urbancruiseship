For example, Bloom et al. [bloom] find that research productivity is falling with semiconductors (Moore's law), agricultural yields, life expectancy, and general technological development. This means that more researchers--41 times more since the 1930s--are required over time to make the same gains. Similar results have been found with machine learning [models_hard], and in China and Germany [ch_ge_research] and Japan [japan_research].", "One reason this is happening may be that, as knowledge advances, it becomes more difficult to operate at the frontier of knowledge [jones_ren].", "Artificial intelligence may again accelerate the rate of advancement [ai_ideas]."]}, {"name": "Economic Stagnation", "content": ["Since the 1970s, economic growth and productivity growth in the United States and other countries has slowed, a trend that has been termed the Great Stagnation [great_stagnation].
