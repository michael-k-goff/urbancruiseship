Such policies help reduce rents in controlled units and increase the length of residence in a rental [rent_control1][rent_control2], but they tend to reduce the number of rental units available [rent_control4][rent_control1][rent_control3], raise rents overall [rent_control4], and cause the quality of the rental stock to deteriorate [rent_control5]. For these reasons, most economists view rent control as a bad policy [rent_control6][rent_control7].", "<span class=\"subsubsubsection\">Eviction Restrictions</span>", "Many cities have adopted restrictions on the ability for landlord to evict tenants or \"Right to Counsel\" regulations, which entitle tenants facing eviction with legal representation. These rules tend to drive up rents to the point where they have a net negative effect on social welfare and increase homelessness [eviction_welfare]. Rental assistance tends to increase welfare and reduce the likelihood that renters will face eviction in the first place [eviction_welfare].", "<span class=\"subsubsubsection\">Public Housing</span>", "Public housing (owned and operated by the government) or social housing (owned and operated by the government or non-profit organizations) is sometimes proposed as a way of reaching people who will not be adequately served by the private market. However, land use and zoning constraints apply to public housing just as much as they to do market housing, and thus these challenges still need to be resolved [public_housing].", "<span class=\"subsubsubsection\">Vacancy Tax</span>", "A vacancy tax is a higher tax rate on properties that are left vacant, implemented with the goal of incentivizing developers to lease properties, reduce blight, and increase housing or commercial real estate supply. Such taxes, such as the vacancy tax that was implemented in Vancouver, British Columbia, have had small effects on the supply of housing or commercial real estate [vacancy_tax2][vacancy_tax1], and they are not an adequate replacement for increasing overall housing supply [vacancy_tax3].", "<span class=\"subsubsubsection\">Speculation</span>", "Speculation can play a role in housing price volatility [housing_spec1]--both on the upside and the downside--but the role of speculation in chronically high prices has been exaggerated. For example, most of the run-up in housing prices in the United States in the early-to-mid 2000s can be explained by supply constraints and low interest rates, rather than the speculative bubble that is often the narrative [housing_bubble]. Furthermore, measures to reduce speculation generally have little effect on prices [housing_spec4][housing_spec2][housing_spec3]. Speculation is more likely to occur in markets facing supply constraints, suggesting that overly restrictive zoning may contribute to speculation [housing_spec5]."]}], "title": "Housing", "parent_link": "cities_socioeconomics", "parent_name": "Socioeconomics", "references": [{"date": "Accessed October 8, 2018", "url": "https://www.eia.gov/consumption/", "title": "Consumption and Efficiency", "ref": "eia_consumption", "author": "U.
