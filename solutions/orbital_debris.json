Above 600 km, and especially above 1000 km, debris is more worrisome because atmospheric drag will not cause objects to fall in reasonable time [debris_time].", "The presence of small debris requires that satellites install shields, which adds 5-10% to the cost of satellite missions [oecd_debris]."]}, {"name": "Kessler Syndrome", "content": ["If a satellite is struck by a piece of debris, the explosion creates new debris, which in turn increases the risk of collision.

Another estimate is that in 200 years, there could be a catastrophic collision every 5-9 years, like the 2009 satellite collision [kessler2].", "In the worst case, Kessler Syndrome may put so much debris into certain orbital lanes that they become unusable.
