More recently, Paul Ehrlich argued in 1968 that there would be near-term, unavoidable famines due to overpopulation [ehrlich]. Starting in 1972, the Club of Rome has echoed the similar concern that a growing world population will lead to the exhaustion of food and other resources [limits_growth].", "Such concerns have not generally materialized. By contrast, Julian Simon argued in 1980 that, given a credible threat of resource shortage, the price signal would bring about new supply or technological substitution [popecon5].", "Taken together, commodities have generally become cheaper over time, even relative to population.", "-simon_abundance.png", "!The Simon Abundance Index tracks how the price of a basket of commodities has evolved with time.
