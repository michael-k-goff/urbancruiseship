There are not very many studies out there quantifying energy requirements of power to food schemes. The Bogdahn and Linder studies were the best I could find, so we're going to make the most of them. The Bogdahn study describes a process involving the bacterium <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and compares it to wheat. The Linder study describes a process involving <i>Methylophilus methylotrophus</i> (that's a methanol eating bacterium if you're up on your Latin) and compares it to soy, so wheat and soy from conventional farming are included for illustration. The Bogdahn study gives the energy estimate explicity. The Linder study does not, but they do say that 1 gram of methanol can be used to produce 0.52 grams of the bacteria by dry weight. So to get an energy estimate we are using the fact that methanol has a energy density of 23.7 MJ/kg (Dana et al.) and that we can convert electricity to methanol at 50% efficiency (Dana et al. again). The Bogdahn study only gives energy to produce hydrogen, but this species of bacteria evidently fixes its own nitrogen and carbon. In the Linder study, they say that ammonia needs to be supply as a nitrogen source, but I would guess the ammonia needs would be comparable to how much is used in fertilizer for conventional farming, which as you can see has much lower energy needs. The figures also don't account for embodied energy in all the equipment, which again I would have to guess is a small fraction the electricity use reported. Note also that in conventional, the energy source is fossil fuels (primary energy) and electricity for the bacteria options, and I'm not dong any sort of primary energy conversion, just noting different sources. Clark and Tilman are used to get the impacts of conventional wheat and soybeans. The IPCC is used to get greenhouse gas impact of energy; I am using figures of 50 gCO2e for solar and nuclear and 450 for gas. Land use is the land use of energy production (see van Zalk and Behrens for land use by source; I am taking midpoints of the ranges), plus an additional 0.0018 m^2/kg for the facilities themselves, which is given by Linder but I am applying it to the Bogdahn study too.", "table": [["<b>Food</b>", "<b>Energy Source</b>", "<b>Energy (kWh/kg dry mass)</b>", "<b>Greenhouse Gas Emissions (kg CO<sub>2</sub>e/kg dry mass)", "<b>Land Use (m<sup>2</sup>yr/kg dry mass)</b>"], ["Conventional Wheat", "Fossil Fuels", 0.6111111111111112, 0.712, 5.45], ["<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>", "Solar Electricity", 11.208, 0.5604, 0.17959803561643836], ["<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>", "Nuclear Electricity", 11.208, 0.5604, 0.0068720082191780826], ["<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>", "Natural Gas Electricity", 11.208, 5.0436000000000005, 0.003673378082191781], ["Conventional Soybeans", "Fossil Fuels", 0.8166666666666667, 0.211, 3.79], ["<i>Methylophilus methylotrophus</i>", "Solar Electricity", 25.320512820512818, 1.266025641025641, 0.40352946050813715], ["<i>Methylophilus methylotrophus</i>", "Nuclear Electricity", 25.320512820512818, 1.266025641025641, 0.013316078000234162], ["<i>Methylophilus methylotrophus</i>", "Natural Gas Electricity", 25.320512820512818, 11.394230769230768, 0.006089904250087811]]}, {"status": "Done", "filename": "algaculture_yield.jpg", "source_file": "ag_intense.py", "references": [{"author": "Lavens, P., Sorgeloos, P.", "url": "http://www.fao.org/3/W3732E/w3732e00.htm#Contents", "journal": "Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Section 2.4", "title": "Manual on the Production and Use of Live Food for Aquaculture", "date": "1996", "ref": "algae_protein"}, {"author": "Clark, M., Tilman, D.", "url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cd5", "journal": "Environmental Research Letters <b>12</b>(6)", "title": "Comparative analysis of environmental impacts of agricultural production systems, agricultural input efficiency, and food choice", "date": "June 2017", "ref": "meat_land_use"}, {"title": "New feed sources key to ambitious climate targets", "url": "https://cbmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-015-0040-7", "journal": "Carbon Balance and Management", "author": "Walsh, B. et al.", "date": "December 2015", "ref": "algae_feed"}], "details": "Yields, per unit protein, of open and close algae systems (as reported by Walsh et al.) compared to some staple crops.

For the agriculture stuff, first we have that 29% of agriculture water is for animal products and 71% for crops, and that division is given by the second Mekonnen and Hoekstra source. The second Mekonnen and Hoekstra also breaks down water by type of animal. The first Mekonnen and Hoekstra source gives the breakdown by crop family (if we really wanted to, we could subdivide those into more subcategories, but I think this is enough detail for our purposes). It should be noted that both of the Mekonnen and Hoekstra sources have what appears to be a different method of accounting for water withdrawal, as their figures are larger than the AQUASTAT figures, so what I did was take the shares of total water in agriculture in the Mekonnen and Hoekstra sources and scaled them to the water in agriculture as reported by AQUASTAT.

For no-till, land savings are based on yield estimates, energy savings based on fuel savings, and greenhouse gas savings are a sum of soil carbon sequestration, fuel savings, methane reduction, and an increase in nitrous oxide which offsets some of the benefits. For organic farming, I'm not sure what the maximum feasible level is, but I am using a 30% rate (on top of current rates) here. Estimates on the savings/cost of organic farming for land use, energy, and greenhouse gases are taken from the figures in organic_yield.jpg, organic_energy.jpg, and organic_impact.jpg respectively. The figures for GM crops are based on converting all of the five crops listed to GM, assuming current technology and none of the technologies under development. As you can see, I only have land use estimates based on yield changes reported in gmo_yield.jpg. For precision farming, I don't know how widely these techniques are used already, so I made a guess that 75% of cropland is converted from non-precision to precision. All impacts are pulled from precision_ag.jpg. See alt_meat.jpg for estimates of savings/costs for cultured meat. The numbers for greenhouses are relatively small because only fruits and vegetables (and some crops like flowers that we're not really talking about here) are practically grown in greenhouses and they are a small portion of all crops. See greenhouse.jpg for range of impacts. Power-to-food impacts are shown in the power_to_food.jpg graphic. The food loss figure is based on the ~34% loss rate worldwide as shown in food_loss.jpg (I could make the numbers more precise by doing the calculations by crop family, but the numbers are so unreliable to begin with that I'm not bothering). Cutting food miles by 75% does not take into account any impacts that result from growing crops in different climates; see world_food_ghg.jpg for the figure there. For overeating figures, see overeat.jpg.<br><br>A few specific comments here.

If you go ahead with a bar plot here, be careful that the World GDP figure doesn't cause the others to be dwarfed. Also be sure to visually distinguish GDP from the others.
