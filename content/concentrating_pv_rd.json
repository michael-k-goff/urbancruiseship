As the technology has already been commercialized on a limited scale, we estimate that only five years of research would be required, and the cost is estimated to be the same $830 million annually as a <a href=\"/solution/energy/mhk\">wave energy</a> research program. We estimate the final price of such a research program to be 7 &cent/kWh, with the same greenhouse gas and other external costs as other forms of solar.
