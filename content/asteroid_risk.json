{"problem": "Asteroid Impact Risk", "solution": "NASA should accelerate monitoring and deflection", "text": ["While many potentially dangerous impactors have been found, there are still civilization-threatening near-Earth asteroids that have not been discovered, and many more dangerous asteroids. Furthermore, few dangerous comets have been discovered. In the event that a dangerous asteroid is found, no deflection mission has yet been demonstrated, though a test, DART, is scheduled to impact a near-Earth asteroid in September 2022. NASA's efforts and budget for planetary protection should be increased."]}
