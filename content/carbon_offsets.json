{"problem": "Carbon offsets are possible ineffective", "solution": "More stringent monitoring of offsets", "text": ["It can be unclear whether a carbon offset, such as an afforestation project or a conservation project, actually reduces emissions as claimed. We recommend more rigorous accounting of emissions reductions from offsets. Some projects, such as the direct air capture programs offers by Climeworks, may be more expensive than other carbon offsets, but we can be more confident that they reduce emissions as claimed."]}
