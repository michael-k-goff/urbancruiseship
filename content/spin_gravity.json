{"problem": "Health risk of microgravity", "solution": "Spin Gravity Research", "text": ["A year or more of microgravity exposure can cause serious health problems [space_health_review], but there is no direct evidence with long-term exposure to the low gravity found on the Moon or Mars. Research in a rotating space station, such as the concept proposed by Gateway Spaceport [gateway_spaceport], would bring more clarity to the health risks."]}
