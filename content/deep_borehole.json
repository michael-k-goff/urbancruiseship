{"problem": "Nuclear Waste", "solution": "Deep Borehole Disposal", "text": ["Although disposing of nuclear waste is inexpective relative to nuclear power, the lack of a permanent solution in the United States serves as a barrier to expansion. Much time and political capital has been expended on the Yucca Mountain site, and permitting there does not look to be resolved in the foreseeable future. Developing and implementing deep borehole disposal (DBD) is another way forward.", "DBD promises to offer fast disposal solutions with high siting flexibility and low financial risk [deep_iso]. Due to the greater siting flexibility, DBD has the potential for greater political acceptability than geologic disposal [dpd_acceptance].", "However, efforts at political acceptance are still needed, as shown by the failure of the Deep Borehole Field Test [dpd_acceptance2]. To move forward, DBD needs to be proven with a similar field test [dpd_test]."]}
