{"problem": "Desire for Scientific Knowledge", "solution": "Radio Telescope of the Far Side of the Moon", "text": ["Radio astronomy is vital in understanding the early universe and for other scientific goals. However, radio astronomy on Earth faces interference from other radio sources, and due to scattering in the ionosphere, it is impossible to observe wavelengths longer than 10 meters [lcrt_phase2]. A radio telescope in a crater on the far side of the Moon, such as the proposed Lunar Crater Radio Telescope (LCRT) [lcrt_overview], would solve these problems and yield far greater observation than a terrestrial radio telescope.", "The LCRT recently received a $500,000 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts grant and, if selected for full development, would likely cost at least $1 billion [lcrt_cost]."]}
