Based on a learning curve analysis, we estimate that wave energy could fall from its present high price to 6 &cent;/kWh. As wave energy is suitable on the coast and where there is good wave resource, we estimate that 20% of the world electricity market would be suitable for wave energy. Financial and environmental benefits are calculated by assuming that wave energy displaces other sources of electricity that are more expensive. By focusing early commercialization on islands and other areas with expensive electricity, the needed subsidy might be reduced.
