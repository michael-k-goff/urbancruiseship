{"problem": "Need for Clean Electricity", "solution": "Subsidize Electricity by Learning-by-Doing Effect", "text": ["Historically, some energy sources such as wind and solar power have benefitted from subsidies, such as the Investment and Production Tax Credits, when they were new technologies and too expensive to be commercialized on their own. Even if a technology is heavily subsidied when it is nascent, it may repay the value of the subsidy by growing much larger. Advanced forms of solar energy, wave energy, and enhanced geothermal systems are examples of technologies that may likewise benefit from subsidies today."]}
