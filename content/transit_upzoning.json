{"problem": "Induced Demand from Transit", "solution": "Mass transit should be accompanied by upzoning", "text": ["The U. S. federal government spent nearly $30 billion on rail and transit in 2021 [usafacts_transit]. However, as noted above, transit spending in and of itself doesn't necessarily lead to increased density or insure that transit is used effectively. Therefore, the federal government should tie transit spending with upzoning.", "Several recent pieces of federal legislation are intended to address the limitations of federal transit funding. The Build More Housing Near Transit Act [transit_upzoning1] would forbid federal transit funds for cities with certain zoning restrictions, and the Prosper Act [transit_upzoning2] would forbid all federal funding to cities with certain restrictions. The Yes In My Backyard Act [transit_upzoning3] and the Housing, Opportunity, Mobility, and Equity Act [transit_upzoning4] would require local governments to demonstrate zoning reform to receive Community Development Block Grants."]}
