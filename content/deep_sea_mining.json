{"problem": "Risks from Deep Sea Mining", "solution": "Authoritative Studies on Ecological Impacts", "text": ["Deep sea mining will be necessary to fulfill the mineral demands of a high renewable economy, and it appears to have lower environmental impacts than terrestrial mining. However, more clarity is needed on risks to ocean floor ecosystems. An authoritative review should be conducted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA).", "The ISA's strategic plan calls for developing regulations of deep sea mining (DSM) in international waters, protecting the marine environment, and encouraging and disseminating scientific research [isa_strategic_plan]. A clear understanding of the ecological impacts of deep sea mining is necessary to achieve. The ISA should commission a report that addresses the following questions.", "|What is the full set of plausible impacts from DSM, and how likely are they? |What ecosystems will be affected by DSM, and how sensitive are they? |How much light and noise pollution and sediment disturbance is expected from DSM? How would these impacts compare with other oceanic activities, such as transcontinental shipping? |What are the benefits of deep sea mining, particularly in displacing terrestrial mining and enabling a shift to low-carbon energy? |What are the important knowledge gaps, and what research will fill them?", "Such a report would be modelled after the International Panel on Climate Change.", "While there is a move today toward developing commercial deep sea mining, the ISA's proposed regulations [isa_strategic_report] are not based in a sufficiently clear understanding of the impacts."]}
