{"problem": "Emissions from Aviation", "solution": "Electrofuels for Aviation", "text": ["Although electrofuels are not generally cost-competitive with other low-carbon fuel options, with aviation, the need for high fuel density precludes electrification, ammonia, or methanol for long-distance flights. For these, electrofuels may be the best low-carbon option."]}
