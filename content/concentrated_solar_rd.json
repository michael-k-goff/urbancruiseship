{"problem": "Cost of Concentrated Solar", "solution": "Concentrated Solar R&D", "text": ["We estimated the expected benefit of a concentrated solar research program to be $66 billion and the cost to be $8 billion. The ultimate cost of concentrated solar is estimated to reach 5 &cent/kWh, and we estimate that it will have the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities to conventional solar. Based on research done by the Department of Energy [csp_cost]. we estimate that a CSP research program will take 10 years to bear fruit, and the cost is the same $830 million per year that a <a href=\"/solution/energy/mhk\">wave energy</a> research program would require.
