{"problem": "F-gases and their contribution to global warming", "solution": "Reduce F-gas emissions from transformers", "text": ["F-gas emissions from transformers can be reduced through more stringent control of leakage with the manufacture, maintenance, and decomissioning phases [china_sf6]. However, deep reductions in SF<sub>6</sub> emissions will require that insulating gas is replaced by a low-global warming potential option. Several options have been considered [sf6_alt6][sf6_alt5][sf6_alt3][sf6_alt2][sf6_alt4][sf6_alt1], but there is no clear consensus as to the best replacement to SF<sub>6</sub>, nor is it clear when such a replacement will be ready to be implemented.", "We propose that the U. S. Department of Energy finance research into low-global warming potential insulating gases for transformers. When such an alternative has been proven to be effective at a carbon mitigation cost of less than $50/ton, we propose that DoE mandate low-GWP insulating gases."]}
