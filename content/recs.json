{"problem": "RECs not always transparent", "solution": "RECs should include load balancing", "text": ["If a particular electricity consumer attains \"100% renewable energy\" by purchasing RECs, it is not necessary for that consumer to handle energy storage or other load balancing tools that would be required in a truly 100% renewable electric grid. We propose extensions to RECs that would account for the need for load balancing."]}
