{"problem": "Emissions and Pollution from Shipping", "solution": "Ammonia for Shipping", "text": ["Ammonia is considered an attractive <a href=\"/solution/energy/transpo_freight\">long-term substitute</a> for heavy fuel oil for shipping. At present, the most effective carbon mitigation option is shipping with ammonia produced from steam methane reforming, which is the most common method of producing ammonia today. Further emissions reductions are possible through carbon capture and sequestration or electrolysis. Following are estimated costs and benefits of building a new 2500 twenty-foot unit equivalent (TEU) container ship with an engine to consume ammonia instead of HFO.", "-ammonia_shipping_cost.svg-80", "!Costs of ammonia fuel are about $246/ton for steam methane reforming without carbon capture and sequestration, as given by Al-Breiki and Bicer [bicer2], $420/ton for SMR with CCS, as noted above, and $830/ton for ammonia from electrolysis with low-carbon electricity, as given by Kim et al. [ammonia_shipping]. A distribution cost for ammonia of about $7/ton is assumed [ammonia_distribution]. Capital investment (CAPEX) and operations and management (O&M) costs are as in Kim et al., except the incremental costs of an ammonia engine are given by TNO [ammonia_distribution]. Emissions factors for heavy fuel oil, ammonia with CCS, and electrolyzed ammonia are from Kim et al., and emissions from SMR ammonia without CCS is assumed to be about 2.4 times greater than those of electrolyzed ammonia, as above for ammonia from solar PV.", "Compared to heavy fuel oil, ammonia eliminates SO<sub>x</sub> and particulate emissions, and reduces NO<sub>x</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions [ammonia_air_pollution]. In 2018, the International Maritime Organization, the agency of the UN that governs, set a goal of reducing shipping's emissions by 50% in 2050 relative to 2008 levels [ammonia_air_pollution], and ammonia is one fuel, alongside methanol and synthetic methane, most likely to achieve this goal [shipping_paper]."]}
