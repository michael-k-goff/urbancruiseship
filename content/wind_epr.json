{"problem": "Waste from Decommissioned Wind Turbines", "solution": "Extended Producer Responsibility for Discarded Blades", "text": ["We proposed that extended producer responsibility rules (EPR) be adopted for wind turbine blades. Such rules would require manufacturers of wind turbines, or utilities that install them, to recycle the blades after they are decommissioned from use. One form such rules might take are mandates to achieve a given recycling rate, where the rate increases as fast as recycling facilities can practically be scaled up [blade_eol].", "An EPR mandate would help facilitate any number of possible uses for recycled turbine blades, such as", "|Powerline structures [turbine_recycle], |Pedestrian bridges for greenways [turbine_recycle], |3D printing feedstock, [blade3d], |New composite materials [blade_composite].", "An EPR mandate may facilitate recycling in other ways, such as spurring the adoption of more recyclable blade material [blade_nrel]."]}
