{"problem": "Threat to biodiversity from roads", "solution": "Wildlife Corridors", "text": ["We propose that states and the federal government make greater investments into wildlife corridors. The exact ideal parameters for wildlife corridors are highly dependent on specific geography and can be difficult to calculate [corridor_optim], but generally wildlife overpasses or underpasses work better than odors, ultrasound, or lighting [road_bank]. The ideal size of a corridor varies by species but is often about 20 meters, with smaller culverts for small animals also appropriate [road_bank]. Corridors should be accompanied by roadside fences to keep wildlife away from the road.", "As of 2008 and over 4 million miles of road, wildlife collisions are estimated to cause 26,000 injuries, 200 fatalities, and almost $9.8 billion (2020 dollars) of damage annually [dvc_cost]. A combination of fencing and wildlife overpasses or underpasses could reduce these damages by 97% [wildlife_97].", "Federal [ifaw_corridor] and state [oregon_corridor] legislation is designed to set standards and provide funding for wildlife corridors."]}
