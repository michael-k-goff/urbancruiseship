{"problem": "isk of uncontrolled warming", "solution": "Mineral-based carbon sequestration", "text": ["Mineral-based carbon sequestestration, whether through enhanced weathering or mineral carbonation discussed above, is a relatively low-risk method of reducing emissions. The high energy consumption means that the process needs to be powered by a low-cost source of clean energy."]}
