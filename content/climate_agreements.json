{"problem": "Weakness of Climate Agreements", "solution": "Agreements should focus on concrete actions", "text": ["Contemporary international climate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, focus primarily on emissions targets, and leave it to individual countries to determine how to meet the targets. We don't expect the Paris Agreement to be much more effective than Kyoto in effecting emissions reductions. Instead, we propose that international agreements center on tangible, concrete actions, such as closing coal-fired power plants."]}
