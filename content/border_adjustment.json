{"problem": "Carbon Leakage", "solution": "Border Adjustment", "text": ["Carbon pricing can put domestic manufacturing at a disadvantage and be undermined by carbon leaking. We propose a border adjustment to remedy this problem. A border adjustment would place a tariff on imported goods that is equal to the difference between the domestic carbon price and the price at which the goods are charged in their home country."]}
