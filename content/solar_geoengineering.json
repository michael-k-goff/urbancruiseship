{"problem": "Risk of uncontrolled warming", "solution": "Research solar geoengineering", "text": ["Due to great uncertainty in the level of risk posed by global warming, it is worth investing in small scale trial research into stratospheric aerosol injection and other forms of solar geoengineering. These methods may reduce warming for low cost, but they carry risk and do not address some other aspects of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, such as ocean acidification. We do not endorse large-scale solar geoengineering at this time due to unknown risk, nor is the eventual possibility of geoengineering a substitute to reducing emissions."]}
