{"problem": "Cost of density restrictions", "solution": "Loosen floor-area ratio rules", "text": ["There are several reasons that cities might choose to limit floor-area ratio (FAR), such as to manage congestion [far_stringency][far_congestion]. However, such rules come at the cost of limiting floor space and driving up costs through scarcity.", "FAR rules tend to be most stringent where land values are high and there is great demand for living and office space, such as Manhattan and Washington, DC [far_stringency_us]. Hence in these areas, there is a significant loss of floor space as a result of regulation.", "Although more building space can create more traffic congestion in an area, more building space near a city center can reduce congestion by reducing the amount of distance people need to travel and hence the amount of driving. For this reason, maximum FAR rules make most sense around the city fringe, while there is a case for minimum FAR rules near a city center [far_optimize]."]}
