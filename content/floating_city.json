{"problem": "Environmental impacts of reclaimed land", "solution": "Floating urban developments", "text": ["We do not believe that general cities at sea, such as envisioned by the Seasteading Institute, is a realistic option, but there is a role for cities on floating platforms near expensive, land-constrained cities, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. In these cases, floating platforms can be an environmentally superior alternative to reclaimed land."]}
