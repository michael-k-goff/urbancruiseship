{"problem": "Negative impacts of fossil fuel subsidies", "solution": "Remove subsidies", "text": ["Most fossil fuel subsidies, as identified by the IMF, are in the form of unpriced externalities. Of more direct subsidies, most are in the form of payments to consumers, such as subsidizing of gasoline or heating oil. We propose that consumer subsidies be replaced by neutral cash payments."]}
