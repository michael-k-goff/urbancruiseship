                                We were inspired by the way modern cruise ships are designed: compact, efficient, and responsive to all the needs of the passengers.  Our goal is to reorient the design of cities and industry along the same lines.  The concept applies to any kind of vehicle and habitat, including an increasingly crowded Planet Earth.

                                After 50 years, the modern environmental movement has achieved limited success, such as some conservation, the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and improvements to automobile and building efficiency.  But the most serious problems persist: fossil fuels, biodiversity loss, climate change, urban sprawl, and landfilling continue to dominate, and the world is not on a trajectory to solve these problems.  We believe that further progress is only possible through innovative, synergistic thinking.

                                We are looking at the world's energy and land use picture in the broadest terms.  While we are still at a preliminary stage in our research, several areas emerge as clear priorities.  Urban designs that simultaneously promote density and comfort are a win for natural habitat, human well-being, and the economy.  In energy production, the most promising concepts should receive much greater research and investment. Our goal is solutions which make sense economically, socially, and environmentally, and there is no shortage of possibility. Most importantly, we seek cross-cutting solutions that recognize how the many facets of today's world fit together.

                                The concept began in discussions between mathematician Michael Goff and designer John van der Harst about why certain environmental problems seem to be intractible.  Both had worked in the environmental movement before in different ways and independently came to the conclusion that fresh approaches were needed.

				<h3>The Team</h3>
				<b>Michael Goff</b> is the president and primary researcher of Urban Cruise Ship. From 2016 to 2018, he worked as an Energy Analyst at The Breakthrough Institute. Previously, he was an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at Vanderbilt University, where he taught undergraduate courses and conducted research in the field of combinatorics.  Michael has an extensive history of volunteer work in policy and advocacy, including volunteering with the YIMBY (Yes In My Back Yard) movement in San Francisco, advocating for a carbon fee and dividend with Citizens Climate Lobby, and as the Advocacy Chair for the Nashville, Tennessee chapter of the United Nations Association. In 2014, Michael was a fellow in East-West: The Art of Dialogue, a program of the Shafik Gabr Foundation, to foster ties between the United States and Egypt. Michael earned his Ph. D. in mathematics from the University of Washington in 2010.  He is interested in machine learning and data science and in 2014 completed a programing at The Data Incubator, where he built a predictive model of usage of New York City’s CitiBike program.  His hobbies include game programming and urban hiking.<br>

				<b>John van der Harst</b> manages research aims, graphic and language standards, human resources, and development for Urban Cruise Ship.  Since 1975, he has been a designer, draftsman and illustrator in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, civil engineering and planning, which have included some interior and graphic design, and structural, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical drawings.  Since 1992 he has been president of Recycling Advocates of Middle Tennessee, with accomplishments that include the world’s only voluntary closure of a large, financially-viable waste-to-energy plant with up-to-date air pollution control equipment, banning treated WTE ash as a loose construction fill material in many U.S. states, and establishing the first statewide “soil-based” compost quality standards as an incentive class.  Doing so involved economic comparative analysis, risk assessment, conducting four pilot wet/dry source separation/processing systems, and touring over 200 facilities across the U.S. and Ontario.  John has described how to achieve true zero-waste across entire municipal waste streams, including economic structures which enable this.  Those include calculating and internalizing presently externalized disposal costs.  John’s advocacy has included leadership on issues ranging from health care, peace, third party and bioregional politics, mass transit, scenery preservation and billboards, economic disparity, and human and animal rights.  Since 2002, John’s methods, successes, and personal lifestyle led to various published profiles, in two newspapers, two magazines, a 2004 documentary “Immaterial John”  and listings in Marquis Who’s Who in America, Who’s Who in the World, and Who’s Who in Science and Engineering.  Hobbies include gardening, cartooning, and triathlons.
