Most heating and cooling energy can be saved through better equipment, compact buildings with shared walls, and more efficient energy sources such as a district heating and cooling system. Thus the challenge of efficient heating and cooling is both a matter of better heating and cooling technology as well as <a href=\"/solution/density\">urban density</a>."

District heating systems require relatively <a href='/solution/density'>high population densities</a> to be economically viable, and their energy and environmental performance is highly dependent on the energy source.
