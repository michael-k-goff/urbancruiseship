				<p><b>John van der Harst</b> manages research aims, graphic and language standards, human resources, and development for Urban Cruise Ship.</p><p>Since 1975, John has been a designer, draftsman and illustrator in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, civil engineering and planning, which have included some interior and graphic design, and structural, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical drawings. Previously, a variety of health-threatening factory work and odd jobs brought gratefulness for often-scarce design work opportunities and sensitivity toward work opportunity and environmental safety.</p>
				<p>Since 1992, John has been president of Recycling Advocates of Middle Tennessee, with accomplishments that include the world’s only voluntary closure of a large, financially-viable waste-to-energy plant with up-to-date air pollution control equipment, banning treated WTE ash as a loose construction fill material in many U.S. states, and establishing the first statewide “soil-based” compost quality standards as an incentive class.  Doing so involved economic comparative analysis, risk assessment, conducting four pilot wet/dry source separation/processing systems, and touring over 200 facilities across the U.S. and Ontario.  John has described how to achieve true zero-waste across entire municipal waste streams, including economic structures which enable this.  Those include calculating and internalizing presently externalized disposal costs.</p>
				<p>John’s advocacy has included leadership on issues ranging from health care, peace, third party and bioregional politics, mass transit, scenery preservation and billboards, economic disparity, and human and animal rights.  Since 2002, John’s methods, successes, and personal lifestyle led to various published profiles, in two newspapers, two magazines, a 2004 documentary “Immaterial John”, by <a href="https://redclaypictures.com/">Red Clay Pictures</a>, and listings in Marquis Who’s Who in America, Who’s Who in the World, and Who’s Who in Science and Engineering. John is among the 5% of their listees Marquis has given a "Lifetime Achievement Award" to. Hobbies include gardening, cartooning, and triathlons.</p>
